## Presentations and Discussions
Where possible, we should use discussions with students already familar with the material to create the information on the fly rather than doing powerpoint or lectures.

### Overview of HTML/CSS/URL/HTTP
Al has some of this material and some students are already familiar with it 

### Introduction to Chrome Developer Tools 
(adapted from https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/)
Who can present this?

### Mozilla git presentation
by wraithan

### Discussion of how to apply git to class
Can David facilitate this?

### Introduction to forms
Al can adapt his courseware for this

## Labs
### Lab 1 - Read, debug, and answer HTML/CSS quiz about a simple webpage

Students will be given a simple XHTML page with internal and external stylesheets, a couple of references, and an online quiz. Working in pairs, they will use Chrome to answer questions about the page, HTML, and CSS.

*Note* - Al can adapt the page from his other courseware, but we'll need to adapt his quizzes from Desire2Learn to something we can use. See http://www.alicekeeler.com/teachertech/2013/03/10/creating-a-quiz-with-a-google-form-and-use-flubaroo-to-grade-it/

### Lab 2 - Upgrade XHTML page to HTML5 with new HTML & CSS features

Students will take the XHTML page from Lab 1 and will be given several change orders and bug reports that will require them to upgrade the page to HTML and add some floating elements, new styles, and responsive media queries. They will have to validate their work against w3c.org and check it in to git to it can be served and demoed to the class.

*Note* - Al can adapt the lab from his other courseware.

*Questions* - Can we use git or dropbox as a simple server? What's the easiest method?

### Lab 3 - Upgrade HTML5 page to include form with validation

Students will be given a HTML5 page and a change order and wireframe that will require them to upgrade the page to add a simple contact/feedback form. They will use a simple node.js based reflector to demonstrate that their form works. They will have to validate their work against w3c.org and check it in to git to it can be served and demoed to the class.

*Note* - Al can adapt the lab from his other courseware. David has the reflector built.

*Questions* - Can we serve the node reflector on a central machine?
