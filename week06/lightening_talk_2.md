#Lightening Talk 2

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this exercise, you will have demonstrated:

0. ...your knowledge of some aspect of ruby
0. ...the use of presentation software
0. ...the use of github gists
0. ...your instructional design ability


## Overview
There are many reasons we practice presentation skills:

0. Success in a meritocracy depends *not only* on the strength of your ideas, but on how well you can *present* your ideas
0. Teaching is a necessary part of learning
0. Doing talks and presenting what you have learned helps establish your reputation
0. In these days where learning to code is made so easy by reading the blogs and watching the videos of those who have gone before you, it's important to pay that boon forward

In this lightning talk, you will present some tiny little aspect of the Ruby language.  This should be an aspect of the language that you are already familiar with. This is not an exercise in learning a new aspect of the language, it is an exercise in sharing what you already know.

While this lightning talk could easily be given at a monthly "Hack 'n' Help" or "Ruby Newbie" meeting, you only need to present to give this presentation to members of your class on Monday of week six.

## Requirements
Your presentation must include the following:

 0. No more than five minutes worth of presentation, including your introduction to the insteractive exercise. You will be cut off at 5 minutes.
 0. Exactly two slides, each of which must incorporate a large picture and 30 point font. (See the [Kawasaki 10/20/30 Rule](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2005/12/the_102030_rule.html).) You can use any presentation software you like, including PowerPoint, LibreOffice, Keynote, or whatever. You cannot just use a text file. One slide should describe the *problem* the language feature addresses and the other could describe how it provides a *solution* to the problm, but neither slide should contain code. Slides are for reaching nomal humans with an immediate, emotional message that supports what you are saying. They should not require your audience to read for detail.
 0. A code snippet in the form of a github gist that illustrates this feature of the language
 0. A very simple interactive exercise for participants to experience that feature of the language themselves. The interactive exercise instructions should be contained in a github gist. The exercise should take no more than five minutes to complete. The exercise will be cut off at 5 minutes.

## Example

Slide text (slides not shown)

0. Problem: How to display variables embedded in text?

0. Solution: Interpolation!

Feature gist:

    a_variable=42
    puts "The answer to life, the universe, and everything is #{a_variable}."
    #=> The answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.

Interactive exercise gist:

    0. Start irb
    1. Type: a_variable = 42
    2. Type: puts "The answer to life, the universe, and everything is #{a_variable}." 
    3. Observe the results.
    4. Make your own string that interpolates the variable and be prepared to share it with the group.

See? Pretty diddly-dang easy, innit?

## Delivery
Prior to 6pm on the Monday of Week 06, you must:

0. Check in your presentation slides to a github repo
0. Create the two github gists
0. Send the addresses of all three to your instuctor at azimmerman@portlandcodeschool.com

You will give this presentation to members of your class during the first hour of class. You will have only 10 minutes total. We will get through all presentations in one sitting.
