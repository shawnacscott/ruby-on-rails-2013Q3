#Mentoring, reuse, and integrity

Mentoring is a common, encouraged process of helping each other learn. However, there's a trick to it: Don't simply tell the person the answer. Don't show them how you did it in your work. Help them learn how to solve the problem themselves by asking them questions, pointing out where they might have missed something, or giving them the right reference in the class materials or out on the web. As the old Chinese proverb says, teach them to fish, give them a fishing pole, but don't give away your own lunch.

Cheating includes any attempt to defraud, deceive, or mislead the instructor in arriving at an honest assessment of your skills, and may include copying answers from other students or using solutions you found out on the web. Plagiarism is a particular form of cheating that involves presenting as one's own the ideas or work of another, and may include using other people's ideas without proper attribution and submitting another person's work as one's own.

Cheating is bad. It will make your instructor hesitate to give you a good recommendation for potential employers. This may apply to both the student who provided the assignment and the student who claimed the assignment as their own. Worse, cheating means you stay stupid (in more ways than one) rather than learning something and nobody wants that.

Mentoring good (and fun for both parties). It helps the mentee learn, obviously. But, more importantly, it provides the *mentor* with an opportunity to teach and to think about how they themselves learn. It makes them more observant, more empathetic and more helpful. All qualities, by the way, that employers look for.

#Licensing

As an aside: Licensing for code reuse is using other people's work with their permission and within their terms. It happens all the time and is one of the reasons developing software is so fun. But you have to be careful to explicitly state where you got the code and under what kind of author's license you are using it. You may also need to demonstrate that you are in compliance with all the other terms of the license, as well.

But, even if you license somebody else's code, you still need to know how it works, to one extent or another. You are always responsible for the behavior of your program whether you wrote all of it or not.
