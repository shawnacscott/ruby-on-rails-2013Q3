#Self-assessment opportunity: Ruby

This is a way for you to find out how much you know about ruby and to learn some new things on your own using personal research techniques.

##How to perform this self-assessment

The essential challenge: Answer the questions below *by yourself*. Do not ask your classmates, your mentor, the IRC channel, a mailing list, or any other human. Look it up and *read* things to find the answers. Unlike the code challenges, this particular aspect of the class is not a team sport. Some aspects of programming are solitary and non-verbal and this is one of them.

You may use any reference book, library, web site, or search engine you like. In fact, most questions require you to support your answer with a reference (book & page or URL). Please do not use videos or screencasts as references. Give me something I can read quickly and I don't have to sit around and watch.

You may not be able to answer all the questions yourself. You aren't being graded by me on this, but you should know all of this by this point in the class. If you don't, think of this as just another homework assignment. After the deadline, we'll discuss the self assessment as a team and you'll be able fill in any gaps.

##How to submit your self-assessment
Make a copy of the markdown source file of this page. Fill in your answers among the questions. Use markdown syntax. Format your answers so that they are easy to distinguish from the questions using indentation, font choice, or some other means. Email the markdown file as text (not as an attachment) to azimmerman@portlandcodeschool.com **before midnight Pacific time, Saturday**. I will review your answers and email you feedback on Sunday and we'll discuss them as a class on next Monday.
